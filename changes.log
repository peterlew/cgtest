Old profiles: VP40, FP40. Now using CGprofile f_prof = cgGLGetLatestProfile(CG_GL_FRAGMENT);


Implementation notes:

smooth transition between arbitrary fractals is possible by interpolating
between iteration functions. However, this requires a shader with the two
functions hard-coded in as func1 and func2. We could achieve this but 
there is a lot of redundancy involved, and for N fractal functions we'd
need N-choose-2, or N(N-1)/2 shaders. Could be worse, I could see a 
program with 20 fractals and 190 shaders. Remember, each fractal function
supports a LOT of variation. 

For next week's demo:
	Let's try to show three or four diff fractals, one morphing 
	into the next. Goal: 4 minute video
